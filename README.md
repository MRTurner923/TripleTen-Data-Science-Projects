# TripleTen-Data-Science-Projects
Sprint projects from TripleTen's Data Science Program

This repository showcases the end of sprint projects I completed during the 8 month Data Science program through TripleTen

## Projects
1. [Instacart EDA] - Performed exploratory data analysis on Instacart transaction data to uncover customer purchasing patterns, popular product categories, and order frequency trends
2. [Megaline Customer Analysis] - Analyzed fictional customer demographics and usage data to identify the highest revenue generating phone plans
3. [Vehicle Resale Data Analysis] - Created an interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore resale dynamics in USA. Utilized Python, pandas, Plotly Express, and Render to deploy the app https://github.com/MRTurner923/Project4/tree/main
4. [Video Game Sales Data Analysis] - Explored global video game sales data to understand market trends, regional preferences, and the impact of platform, genre, and release year on sales performance
5. [Zuber Rideshare Analysis] - Used Python and SQL to investigate the relationship between weather conditions and rideshare demand, uncovering seasonal patterns and trip duration variability
6. [Megaline Plan Prediction Model] - Built a classification model to predict which mobile phone plan a customer is most likely to choose based on usage behavior and demographic features
7. [Beta Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model] - Developed and optimized a machine learning model to identify customers at risk of leaving the bank, utilizing transacation history and account features to identify ways to improve customer retention
8. [Oil Well Profitability Forecasting for OilyGiant] - Built a predictive model to estimate oil reserves across three regions, selecting optimal drilling sites based on projected profitability and risk analysis using bootstrapping techniques
9. [Gold Recovery Prediction Model for Zyfra] - Designed a machine learning prototype to forecast gold yield from ore extraction and purification data, enabling production optimization and identification of unprofitable parameters
10. [Insurance Benefit Prediction & Privacy Protection for Sure Tomorrow] - Evaluated machine learning solutions for customer targeting and benefit prediction and implemented data masking techniques to safeguard customers' personal information while preserving model performance
11. [Used Car Price Prediction Model for Rusty Bargain] - Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models to estimate market value of used cars based on historical data including technical specifications and trim versions. Comparisons were made between CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost to find the fastest and most reliable price estimates for new users
12. [Hourly Taxi Demand Forecasting for Sweet Lift] - Built a time series prediction model to estimate airport taxi orders one hour in advance, achieving a target RMSE value to support driver allocation during peak demand
13. [Sentiment Classification Model for Film Junky Union] - Built a text classification model using IMDB reviews to detect negative sentiment, achieving a target F1 score to support automated filtering and categorization for a classic film community platform
14. [Age Verification Model for Good Seed Supermarkets] - Developed a computer vision model to estimate customer age from checkout images, enabling real-time compliance with alcohol sales regulations and reducing the risk of underage transactions
15. [Client Churn Prediction Model for Interconnect] - Built a machine learning model to forecast customer churn using service and contract data, enabling targeted retention strategies through promotional offers and personalized plans
